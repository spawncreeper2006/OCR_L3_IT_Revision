Which of the following is the fastest CPU based on this information?
A CPU with 2 Cores running at 2.5GHz
A CPU with 4 cores running at 1GHz
A GPU With 100 Cores running at 5GHz
A Monitor.
What is clock speed measured in?
Hertz
Flops
Cores
Seconds
Why does a computer with more Cache run faster?
Because there is a greater chance that requested data will be in Cache and a full request from the RAM is not required.
Because it improves clock speed.
Because it improves core count.
Because it increases RAM size.
What are three main CPU performance factors?
clock speed, cache size, number of cores
clock size, number of caches, core size
fetch, decode, execute
CPU, RAM, ALU
